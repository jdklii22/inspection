Key Discussion Points
---------------------

### Regulatory Examinations and Audits

-   OCC CMS Examination: Successfully completed exit meeting with very positive outcome; advisory letter expected to be issued soon. OCC plans to return in Q4 for a traditional CRA exam.
-   Internal Audit: CMS audit concluding with a satisfactory rating and only minor, low-risk process-oriented issues requiring response drafting.

### Personnel and Organizational Changes

-   New Hire: Sarah Resmer (no H) joined as Director for fair and responsible banking compliance, bringing over a decade of specialized experience.
-   Role Transition: Ellie will shift from leading CRA/fair lending activities to a strategic role overseeing compliance program management.
-   Upcoming Retirement: Anticipated retirement in July prompting talent planning and role reimagining.
-   Leadership Growth: Multiple new executives across the organization (Treasurer Kevin, CTO, Kelly as Deputy CRO) supporting expansion.

### Technology Enhancements

-   AI Implementation: Deployed natural language processing model to identify problematic complaints, reducing manual review time from 4 hours to minutes.
-   Future Roadmap: Planning to use NLP for thematic trend analysis beyond keyword searches.
-   GRC Tool Evaluation: Pursuing a "right-sized" Governance, Risk, and Compliance tool to consolidate disparate systems (Teammate, FSC, SharePoint) for improved risk assessment and efficiency, in partnership with ERM.

### Blue Foundry Acquisition Impact

-   Minimal Operational Impact: Not expected to significantly affect compliance department due to standard products and small volumes.
-   Data Analysis: Shelly and Sarah will analyze HMDA and CRA data to ensure proper mapping and identify potential CRA investments or renewals.
-   Personnel Assessment: Target's compliance coordinator is competent but lacks deep subject matter expertise needed for direct team integration.

### SBA National Lending Initiative

-   New Team: Hired group focused on national SBA lending within commercial bank.
-   Process Integration: Applications will flow through existing processes; no major compliance concerns identified.
-   CRA Risk: Key concern is impact on CRA in-and-out ratios; enhanced monitoring framework required.
-   Strategic Planning: Prompted broader conversation about CRA compliance levers ahead of next year's examination.

### Loan Purchase Considerations

-   Potential Purchase: Evaluating $200M loan book purchase.
-   Documentation Challenge: Focus on ensuring proper CRA reporting documentation, particularly challenging with second-generation loans where original source data may be limited.
-   Ratio Analysis: In-and-out ratio impact is part of the evaluation; loans may be in-market or determined to have negligible effect.
