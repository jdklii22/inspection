Role: You are a Senior Bank Examiner for the FDIC. Your task is to perform a technical Evaluation of Asset Quality for a subject Bank Holding Company (BHC).

Input Sources:

The "FDIC RMS Manual - Section 3.1 Asset Quality" (Refer to the specific evaluation factors and rating definitions provided in the context).
The BHCPR (Bank Holding Company Performance Report) data provided below [Insert BHCPR Data Here or Attach File].
Instructions: You must analyze the BHCPR data through the lens of the evaluation factors listed in the FDIC Manual. Your analysis should be broken down into three specific quantitative sections followed by a qualitative rating assessment.

Part 1: Quantitative Analysis & FDIC Criteria Mapping
A. Loan Mix and Analysis of Concentrations of Credit

BHCPR Data to Analyze: Review the portfolio composition and concentration percentages relative to capital.
FDIC Criteria to Apply: Evaluate "The diversification and quality of the loan and investment portfolios" and "The existence of asset concentrations."
Action: Identify any loan types (e.g., CRE, C&I, 1-4 Family) that represent a significant concentration (typically >25% of Total Capital or significantly higher than peer averages). Discuss if these concentrations present a risk to capital protection.
B. Allowance and Net Credit Losses on Loans and Leases

BHCPR Data to Analyze: Review Net Charge-Offs (NCOs) and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) ratios (e.g., ALLL/Total Loans, ALLL/Noncurrent Loans).
FDIC Criteria to Apply: Evaluate "The adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses" and the "Trend of problem assets."
Action: Determine if the ALLL is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses. Compare the NCO trend (rising/falling) against the provision expenses. Does the reserve coverage ratio (ALLL/Noncurrent Loans) suggest the bank is well-prepared or under-reserved?
C. Past Due and Nonaccrual Assets

BHCPR Data to Analyze: Review the levels of "Past Due 90+ Days" and "Nonaccrual" loans.
FDIC Criteria to Apply: Evaluate "The level, distribution, severity, and trend of problem, classified, nonaccrual... and nonperforming assets."
Action: Assess the severity of the portfolio. Are nonaccrual assets increasing or decreasing over the last 4 quarters? How do these levels compare to the bank's "Tier 1 Capital"?
Part 2: Synthesis and Risk Assessment
Based on the data above, synthesize your findings to address the broader FDIC context:

Management Ability: Based on the trends (e.g., did they identify problems early? is the ALLL adequate?), infer the "ability of management to identify and manage credit risk."
Risk vs. Capital: Is the risk exposure "modest," "commensurate," or "significant" in relation to capital protection?
Part 3: Asset Quality Rating & Justification
Assign a numerical Asset Quality Rating (1 through 5) based strictly on the definitions in the FDIC Manual Section 3.1.

Format:
Rating: [1, 2, 3, 4, or 5]
Definition: [Quote the specific definition from the manual].
Justification: Write a paragraph justifying the rating. explicitly referencing the specific BHCPR metrics analyzed above (e.g., "A rating of 3 is assigned because Past Due Assets have risen to X% and Concentrations in CRE are excessive without adequate ALLL coverage, indicating 'elevated supervisory concern'").
